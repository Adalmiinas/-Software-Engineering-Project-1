# -Software-Engineering-Project-1
Software Engineering Project 1 done in the fall of 2021.
In the course, we got to participate in our first real project. Our project was done to Solita and they asked us to create an escape room inspired recruitment game from scratch. As the tool, we were asked to use a low-code tool Outsystems. This project taught me a lot about project management and it was fun to learn and play with a brand new tool. My responsibility on the project was to create and implement the java room of the game.
